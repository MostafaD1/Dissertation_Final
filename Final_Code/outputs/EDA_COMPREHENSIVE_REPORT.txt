----------------------

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Focus predictive models on sensors with significant failure differences
2. Consider removing highly correlated sensors to reduce multicollinearity
3. Implement more frequent monitoring for machines with higher failure rates
4. Investigate temporal patterns in failure occurrences
5. Address missing data issues, especially in critical sensors
